/**
Given a set S, find all the maximal subsets whose sum <= k. For example, if S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and k = 7

Output is: {1, 2, 3} {1, 2, 4} {1, 5} {2, 5} {3, 4}

Hint:

– Output doesn’t contain any set which is a subset of other.

– If X = {1, 2, 3} is one of the solution then all the subsets of X {1} {2} {3} {1, 2} {1, 3} {2, 3} are omitted.

– Lexicographic ordering may be used to solve it
