Given a binary tree, print it vertically. The following example illustrates vertical order traversal.


           1
        /    \
       2      3
      / \    / \
     4   5  6   7
             \   \
              8   9 
               
			  
The output of print this tree vertically will be:
4
2
1 5 6
3 8
7
9
